An [**Angular-6 based front end**](https://github.com/shawn-dsilva/angular-src-mean-user-auth) is in a seperate repo

## CHANGES:
- git submodule `angular-src-mean-user-auth` **removed** from this repo,
    you can run `ng serve` after cloning the seperate repo `angular-src-mean-user-auth` and it will connect to the Node.JS + MongoDB API server at `localhost:3000`,while serving the frontend at `localhost:4200`, these are defaults.
